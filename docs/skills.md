# My Skills & Technologies

## Programming Languages

### Frontend Technologies

I absolutely love working on the frontend! **TypeScript and JavaScript** are my go-to languages, and I've been working with them for years. I'm really passionate about **React.js** - I've built so many projects with it and I love how it makes building user interfaces so intuitive and fun.

**Next.js** is another framework I'm really excited about. I love how it combines the best of React with server-side rendering and static generation. It's become my preferred choice for full-stack React applications.

I also work with **HTML/CSS** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Tailwind has been a game-changer for me - I love how it makes styling so much faster and more consistent. I also have experience with **jQuery** for DOM manipulation when working with legacy systems.

### Backend Technologies

On the backend, I work primarily with **Node.js** and **Python**. I love Node.js because it lets me use JavaScript on both frontend and backend, which makes development so much smoother.

**Python** is another language I'm really passionate about. I use it for everything from web development with **Django** to building APIs with **FastAPI**. I also have experience with **C#** from my earlier projects, and **PHP** for WordPress development.

## Database Technologies

### Relational Databases

I work with several relational databases, and each has its strengths. **PostgreSQL** is probably my favorite - I love its advanced features and how well it handles complex queries. I also work with **MySQL** and **SQL Server** depending on the project requirements.

I really enjoy database design and optimization. There's something satisfying about creating efficient data structures and writing queries that perform well. I've also worked on data migration and ETL processes, which taught me a lot about data management.

## API Development & Integration

### API Technologies

I love building APIs! I work with **REST APIs**, **GraphQL**, and **TRPC**. Each has its place, and I enjoy choosing the right tool for the job. **REST** is great for simple, straightforward APIs, while **GraphQL** is perfect when you need flexibility in data fetching.

**TRPC** is something I've been really excited about lately - it provides end-to-end type safety, which makes development so much more reliable and enjoyable.

I also work with **ETL/ELT** processes and **WebHooks** for event-driven architectures. These are essential for building modern, scalable applications.

### Third-Party Integrations

I've integrated with many third-party services, including **Salesmate** (CRM), **Mailchimp** (email marketing), **MemberPress** (WordPress membership), and **Sticky** (customer support). I also have experience with **Bank APIs** for payment processing.

## Development Tools & Practices

### Version Control & Collaboration

**Git** is essential to my workflow, and I use it for everything from personal projects to large team collaborations. I'm comfortable with both **GitHub** and **GitLab**, and I follow best practices for code reviews and collaborative development.

### Development Environment

I use **Docker** for containerization, which makes deployment and development so much more consistent. I also work with **Turborepo** for monorepo management, which is great for large projects with multiple packages.

I do most of my development in **VS Code**, and I'm comfortable working in the terminal and command line for various tasks.

### Cloud & Deployment

I have experience with **AWS**, particularly **EC2** instances, and I've worked with **serverless architectures** and **VPS** management. Cloud deployment is something I'm always learning more about, and I love how it makes scaling applications so much easier.

## Specialized Skills

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

This is one of my favorite areas! I've built **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models for text classification, and I absolutely love working with **machine learning**. I use Python with libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and NLTK.

I've also built APIs to expose ML models as services, which taught me a lot about how to integrate AI into real-world applications.

### Data Processing & Analysis

I enjoy **web scraping** and **data extraction** - there's something satisfying about collecting and processing data from various sources. I also work on **data analysis** and **business intelligence** projects, helping companies make data-driven decisions.

I've learned about **process optimization** using BPM and BPMN methodologies, which has been really valuable for understanding how technology can improve business operations.

### Security & Encryption

Security is really important to me. I've implemented **AES 128 encryption** for sensitive data, and I always think about **data security** and **secure authentication** when building applications.

I also focus on **API security** and follow best practices for secure development.

## Languages

### English

I'm **fluent in English** (C1/C2 level) and I use it daily in my professional work. I can read, write, speak, and understand English at an advanced level, which has been really helpful for working with international teams and clients.

### Spanish

**Spanish is my native language**, and I'm completely comfortable using it in all professional contexts. Being bilingual has opened so many doors for me, especially when working with diverse teams and clients.

## Soft Skills

### Leadership & Management

I love **leading teams** and **managing projects**. I've learned that being a good leader isn't just about technical skills - it's about communication, empathy, and helping others succeed.

I also enjoy **mentoring other developers** and sharing knowledge. I believe that the best developers are those who help others grow.

### Problem Solving

I'm really passionate about **problem-solving**. I love breaking down complex problems, thinking creatively about solutions, and debugging issues systematically.

I also enjoy **process improvement** and finding ways to optimize workflows and systems.

### Communication

**Communication** is so important in software development. I've learned to write clear technical documentation, present ideas effectively, and collaborate with different teams.

I also enjoy working directly with clients and understanding their needs, which has taught me a lot about **client relations** and managing expectations.

## What I'm Learning

I'm always learning new technologies and improving my skills. Right now, I'm particularly interested in:

- Advanced cloud technologies and serverless architectures
- More AI/ML frameworks and techniques
- New frontend frameworks and tools
- DevOps and deployment automation
- Performance optimization and scalability

I believe that being a good developer means never stopping learning, and I'm always excited to pick up new skills and technologies!
