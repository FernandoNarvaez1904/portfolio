# DojangPulse

**Open Source Project** | _Lead Maintainer_

## Overview

DojangPulse is my new open-source project - a management system designed specifically for martial arts schools and tournaments. I'm leading this development because I'm deeply involved in martial arts myself, and I've seen how much valuable teaching time gets lost to endless paperwork and administrative chaos. With most of my professional work being closed source, I wanted to create something that showcases my skills while solving a real problem I understand. The system addresses the core issues that plague martial arts schools: managing student registrations, tracking belt progressions, organizing tournaments, and handling class schedules. It's built by someone who's lived the martial arts experience, for instructors who want to focus on what matters - teaching. Throughout this journey, I'll be documenting every step, sharing the technical hurdles, architectural decisions, and insights gained as I bring this vision to life.
