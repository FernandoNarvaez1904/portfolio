# My College Experience

## Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering

**Keiser University** | _2020 - 2023_

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Keiser University. My college years were extremely important for my development as an engineer. I did things like founding the Software Engineering club, creating the first Software Engineering Fest, serving as a dean's assistant, and contributing to curriculum development. I was fortunate to receive a grant that covered 80-85% of my college career based on my academic excellence and martial arts achievements. Keiser University is based in the United States but has a campus here in Nicaragua, which gave me the opportunity to study locally while still getting a high-quality American education.

## What I'm Proud Of

### Dean's Assistant Role

One of the most valuable experiences I had was serving as the dean's assistant. This role taught me so much about leadership, administration, and how educational institutions work. I got to work closely with faculty and staff.

I also helped develop the robotics curriculum, creating weekly lab projects for the students. One of the key projects I developed was a temperature monitoring and display system using Arduino, which served as the midterm project for the robotics course. This project featured real-time temperature sensing, LCD display output, and automated cooling control.

### Founding the Software Engineering Club

I'm really proud of founding the Software Engineering club at my university. I noticed that there wasn't a strong community for software engineering students, so I decided to create one. We organized regular meetings, technical workshops, and created a space where students could share knowledge and collaborate on projects.

The club became a place where students could learn from each other, work on group projects, and even bring in industry speakers. It was amazing to see how it grew and how many students benefited from having that community.

Leading the Software Engineering club taught me so much about leadership and community building. I learned how to:

- Organize events and workshops
- Facilitate knowledge sharing among students
- Create an inclusive environment where everyone felt welcome

### Creating Software Engineering Fest

One of my biggest accomplishments was starting and planning the first Software Engineering Fest. I wanted to create an event where students could showcase their projects, learn from industry professionals, and network with each other.

The first year was a lot of work - I had to plan everything from scratch, coordinate with speakers, organize the venue, and make sure everything ran smoothly. But it was so worth it! The event was a huge success, and now it's become an annual tradition that students look forward to every year.

Planning and executing the first Software Engineering Fest was one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my university career. I had to:

- Coordinate with multiple stakeholders (students, faculty, industry professionals)
- Manage logistics and event planning
- Create marketing materials and promote the event
- Handle the technical aspects of presentations and demonstrations

## The Impact

Looking back, I'm really proud of what I accomplished during my time at Keiser University. The Software Engineering club I founded is still active and helping students, and the Software Engineering Fest has become a tradition that brings the community together every year.

My work as a dean's assistant and curriculum contributor showed me that I could make a difference beyond just my own studies. It taught me the importance of giving back to the community and helping others succeed.

The scholarship I received was validation that I was on the right path, and it motivated me to work even harder and take on leadership roles that I might not have considered otherwise.

My education at Keiser University gave me the technical foundation I needed, but it also taught me that I love leading, teaching, and building communities. These experiences shaped who I am as a developer and as a person, and I continue to apply these lessons in my professional work today.

I'm always looking for opportunities to mentor other developers, contribute to educational initiatives, and build communities around technology. My university experience showed me that the best developers are those who not only write great code but also help others grow and succeed.
