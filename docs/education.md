# My College Experience

## Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering

**Keiser University** | _2020 - 2023_

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Keiser University. My college years were extremely important for my development as an engineer. I did things like founding the Software Engineering club, creating the first Software Engineering Fest, serving as a dean's assistant, and contributing to curriculum development. I was fortunate to receive a grant based on my academic excellence and martial arts achievements. Keiser University is based in the United States but has a campus here in Nicaragua, which gave me the opportunity to study locally while still getting a high-quality American education.

## What I'm Proud Of

### Dean's Assistant Role

One of the most valuable experiences I had was serving as the dean's assistant. This role taught me so much about leadership, administration, and how educational institutions work. I got to work closely with faculty and staff.

I also helped develop the robotics curriculum, creating weekly lab projects for the students. One of the key projects I developed was a temperature monitoring and display system using Arduino, which served as the midterm project for the robotics course. This project featured real-time temperature sensing, LCD display output, and automated cooling control.

### Founding the Software Engineering Club

I'm really proud of founding the Software Engineering club at my university. I noticed that there wasn't a strong community for software engineering students, so I decided to create one. We organized regular meetings, technical workshops, and created a space where students could share knowledge and collaborate on projects.

The club became a place where students could learn from each other, work on group projects, and even bring in industry speakers. It was amazing to see how it grew and how many students benefited from having that community.

### Creating Software Engineering Fest

One of my biggest accomplishments was starting and planning the first Software Engineering Fest. I came up with the idea for the event, which I started as an initiative from the Software Engineering club, and with my role as the dean's assistant, I was key in supervising the student teams, coming up with the concepts, and helping coordinate the entire event. I wanted to create an event where students could showcase their projects, learn from industry professionals, and network with each other. The fest also helps in attracting new students to the university and allows our students networking opportunities for summer jobs.

The first year was a lot of work - we had to plan everything from scratch, coordinate with speakers, organize the venue, and make sure everything ran smoothly. In the first Software Engineering Fest, I had my own project and also represented the University itself with a remote control car demonstration, all while helping coordinate the event.

In later years, I was not as involved in the organization of the event because the university took it more over, but I was still participating in all fests with my own project. In those later years, I was given the opportunity to be a speaker teaching robotics and GraphQL.

The event was such a success that it is now a yearly event for the university, and I was even invited this year (2025) as a special guest for a panel.
