# My Work Experience

## Current Role

### Ahinko International

**Full-Stack Web Developer** | _October 2024 - Present_

I work closely with clients to maintain a custom WordPress theme using PHP, Tailwind, and jQuery. This frontend connects with a Node.js backend built with Express. I have helped with the implementation of the REST API that connects with third party services like Salesmate, Mailchimp, MemberPress, Sticky, etc.

I also created a frontend in React.js for an internal application to be sold in the future. The frontend connects with a REST API created with FastAPI. I created the frontend using React.js, Tailwind, Tanstack Router, React Query v5, and TypeScript. I am using the OpenAPI (Swagger) spec to auto generate the types.

## Previous Roles

### American Nicaraguan School

It sends automatic emails to parents and directors when a kid visits the clinic, or when certain procedures or medicine need to be given. It encrypts all data using AES 128, and it also creates beautiful graphs to analyze the "health status" of the school and help detect environmental factors. The technologies used are Next.js, Node, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Turborepo, Typescript and TRPC.

### Ostuma Consulting

## What I've Learned

Each role and project has taught me something valuable. I've learned that being a good developer isn't just about writing code - it's about understanding business needs, working with teams, and always being willing to learn new technologies. I've also discovered that I really enjoy mentoring others and sharing knowledge, which is why I've been involved in education and community building throughout my career.

The variety of projects I've worked on has given me a broad perspective on software development, from simple websites to complex AI systems. I love that every day brings new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
