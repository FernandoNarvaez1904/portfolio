# My Work Experience

## Professional Experience

### Ahinko International

**Full-Stack Web Developer** | _October 2024 - Present_

I work closely with clients to maintain a custom WordPress theme using **PHP**, **Tailwind**, and **jQuery**. This frontend connects with a **Node.js** backend built with **Express**. I have helped with the implementation of the REST API that connects with third party services like **Salesmate**, **Mailchimp**, **MemberPress**, **Sticky**, etc.

I also created a frontend in **React.js** for an internal application to be sold in the future. The frontend connects with a REST API created with **FastAPI**. I created the frontend using **React.js**, **Tailwind**, **Tanstack Router**, **React Query v5**, and **TypeScript**. I am using the **OpenAPI (Swagger)** spec to auto generate the types.

### American Nicaraguan School

**Full-Stack Web Developer** | _June 2024 - October 2024_

I successfully launched an enrollment platform that allows parents to securely register their children for after school activities. Built with **Next.js**, **Node.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** in a **Turborepo** monorepo, the platform features real-time availability updates and **AES encryption** to maintain student privacy. I also maintained their existing **WordPress** website, ensuring smooth operation and regular updates. Additionally, I created many other smaller projects and tools to support various school operations.

Beyond development work, I also served as an assistant teacher for the robotics class, helping students learn programming concepts and hands-on robotics skills while supporting the main instructor with student guidance. I was part of creating a new coordinate and navigation system for the robotics team's WRO (World Robot Olympiad) competition.

### Ostuma Consulting

**Junior Consultant and Freelancer** | _2021 - 2023_

My role at Ostuma Consulting was quite varied, spanning both technical development and business consulting. Here are some of the key projects I worked on:

- **NLP AI Models**: Developed two natural language processing classification AI models using **Python** and **SpaCy**, with a **Django**-based API that enabled other services to interact with the models seamlessly.

- **Government Tender Scraping Bot**: Created an automated web scraping bot that collected government tender offers and intelligently filtered them to identify the most relevant opportunities for the company's business, significantly improving the tender selection process.

- **Secure Anonymous Chat Platform**: Built a confidential meeting platform with advanced features including message classification, voting systems, and message merging capabilities. The platform was built with **React** frontend and **Django** with **GraphQL** API backend, deployed on **AWS EC2**.

### Smart Billing Integrated System

**Junior Developer** | _2019 - 2021_

I was part of a development team responsible for building a comprehensive Inventory and POS System. I contributed to both the backend development using **C#** and the frontend implementation. My primary responsibility was creating and maintaining the API endpoints for the inventory module, ensuring seamless data flow between the frontend and database.

Additionally, I developed an internal messaging system similar to Slack for the POS system using **Django** for the backend and **React** for the frontend, enabling real-time communication within the organization.

## Freelance Experience

### Grocery Store Online Ordering System

I developed a web app where local grocery store clients could create delivery orders that are sent to **WhatsApp** for processing. I used the **T3 stack** (**Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **tRPC**, **Prisma**) and integrated with an existing POS database using **SQL Server**. Here its a video on how the platfform works:

### Job Application Web Application

I built a web application where people can apply for jobs at a major credit institution in my country. The application was built with **Next.js** and connected to a **SQL Server** database. It handled document uploads to cloud storage, integrated with their existing hiring process, and featured a dynamic multi-step form for job applications.

### Programming Education Curriculums

I designed two comprehensive programming curriculums for a local technology education company. The first curriculum was designed for kids and used **Minecraft Education Edition** to make programming fun and engaging. The second curriculum was created for teenagers and focused on teaching modern web development with **Django** and **React**.

### A ton of WordPress websites

I have developed numerous **WordPress** websites for various clients, creating custom themes, plugins, and implementing responsive designs. In most of them I used **Elementor** for page building. These projects involved custom **PHP** development, theme customization, plugin integration, and ensuring optimal performance and **SEO**.
